# Group 14
## NFL Discussion

The Team will share most of the backend development so everyone gets the experience of setting up a Database and API connection.
Work will be split up when we begin front-end development or when we get a better grasp on the development process of our project or when our team is
more comortable working with the technology stack.

## Team
- Kevin Ramirez
- Jujhar Singh
- Chris Rattanasamay

# Workflow Strategy

We will create a branch for every major change we do. Such as when we are creating the initial database connection that will be on its own branch and merged back onto main when it is functioning properly. When a team memeber decides they want to fix something or add on another feature they will create their own branch and notify the rest of the team so no two people are working on the same feature independently.

# Development Tools
